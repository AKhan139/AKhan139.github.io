# Rush Hour
## How do Chicago's neighborhoods use public transportation?

This is the GitHub repository for my digital humanities project, _Rush Hour_, a visual essay examining the relationship between the neighborhoods of Chicago and its public transportation system.

This project will be a website, designed to emulate the visual essays published by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool). I wanted to build something with the same effect as a project on their website, something visually appealing and centered around a relevant and interesting (to me at least) topic. 

I'm currently working with Tableau Desktop, Social Explorer, Bootstrap, and GitHub Pages to build the website. Stay tuned for updates and the final version, to be prototyped by April 25th.
