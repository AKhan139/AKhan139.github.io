            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="heading-line"></div>
            <p>Welcome to Rush Hour!</p>
            <p>One of my favorite parts about living in Chicago is the public transportation system. I went to college in a tiny rural town that was an hour away from any cities, with no public transportation to speak of. Chicago's public transit might not be one of the best in the world, but I love being able to get anywhere I want in the city without needing to get in a car. Since moving here, I've become very passionate about public transportation. This is partly because I discovered a Facebook page called New Urbanist Memes for Transit Oriented Teens (aka NUMTOTs) that I thought was just a place for people to share train memes, but is actually for members to seriously discuss anything and everything related to urbanism. Public transit and Chicago come up a lot.</p>
            <p>It took me some time to develop an idea for what I wanted to build for my Master's project, but I knew I had to research and create something I was passionate about. When I discovered that the Chicago Transity Authority (CTA) had a *ton* of open data about their systems, a public transit-related project quickly became the first choice on a very short list of topic ideas. I needed another piece though; what questions could I ask that hadn't already been asked?</p>
            <p>Another one of my favorite aspects of Chicago is that its made up of so many unique and diverse neighborhoods. From Rogers Park to Logan Square, each neighborhood is distinct and has its own personality. After experiencing many of them, and how different they were from each other, I thought about how else they might differ. For example, how does each neighborhood use the public transportation in its area? Is it different from all the rest, or different from how it was ten years ago? How have the neighborhoods changed, and was it because of the CTA, or did the neighborhoods change first and take the CTA with them?</p>
            <p>I love Chicago, and I wanted to know more about the neighborhoods the trains took me through, so I built this website. I hope you enjoy exploring what I found.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <div class="heading-line"></div>
            <p>I started with the CTA's open data, available at the City of Chicago data portal. The data sets they have published are massive. I used Tableau Desktop to aggregate and visualize the many, many lines of data about L station entries and bus rides over time. The CTA started recording data in 1988, so there are annual ridership data for buses and trains from then until now. In 2001, the CTA also began recording total ridership by day type. The day types were weekdays, weekends, and holidays/Sundays. I mostly worked with the L station entry totals from 2001 to 2018. I also worked with the bus ridership totals from 2001 to 2018, but there are many bus routes, and it was much harder to find trends in the bus data. I also don't have the same amount of knowledge about the bus system as I do the L system, so I stuck to what I know. I also included the annual totals that the CTA has provided since 1988, to get a better idea of what the long-term trends look like in CTA usage.</p>
          	<p>Once I had my train data ready, I needed to get demographic information. My research questions were whether the CTA affects neighborhood demographics, or if it's the opposite, and neighborhood demographics affect how public transportation is used. I found a resource called Social Explorer through the Loyola library, recommended to me by Dr. David Van Zytfeld, Director of the Center for Urban Research and Learning. Social Explorer is a powerful data tool that offers the ability to make comprehensive data reports as well as informative maps and visualizations that allow you to tell stories with the data you find. I used the data from maps of Chicago in 2006 and 2017, because those were the most consistent datasets I could find, with most of my data coming from American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates. They had the added benefit of being well-placed in the range of years that the CTA provided quality L station entry data. I visualized the data I found on Social Explorer and compared it to the CTA visualizations.</p>

            <h3>What does it all mean?</h3>
            <p>Figure 1 is an overview of the total monthly rides from January 2001 to October 2018 for every L station in Chicago, including those that are now defunct or that were only open temporarily. They can be filtered to include as few as one station entry and can be sorted alphabetically, by number of rides, or by earliest open date. This view is good for getting a general sense of how many L stations there are and how they have been trending over the past 17 years.</p>
            <p>Figure 2 is a grouping of what I like to call the "Peak Baseball" graphs. These curves are the station entries for the Addison and Sox-35th L stations respectively. Their lines are remarkably similar, and differ really only in magnitude. I believe this is because of the baseball stadiums located right next to the L stations in this view. Addison has much higher entries due to its proximity to Wrigley Field, and the peaks coincide with July and August, the height of baseball season in the US. Sox-35th has a steep valley and no entries in June, July, and August of 2013, a period of time when the station was closed from May 19th - October 20th as part of a Red Line reconstruction project. The valleys in both stations' graphs coincide with the winter off-season.</p>
            <p>Figure 3 is a grouping of the airport L stations, O'Hare and Midway, on the Blue and Orange lines respectively. O'Hare has more riders overall and trends fairly steeply upward, while Midway has a much more gentle increase, if any. The relative differences between the two airports makes sense, as O'Hare services more destinations and is a larger travel hub than Midway. The patterns of ridership are very similar in these stations as well, except for a steep valley in summer 2008 when O'Hare suffered a large loss in traffic due to the financial crisis. Peak travel times from the airports seem to be generally in August, with the least travelling by the L happening in February.</p>
            <p>Figures 4 and 5 show L station entries for stations located by almost all of Chicago's major universities. The first set of these stops includes Fullerton, Loyola, and UIC Halsted, while the second set includes all the stops on the Purple Line located by Northwestern University in Evanston: Davis, Foster, and Noyes. DePaul University's campus is located right on the Fullerton stop, while Loyola University is right next to Loyola (of course), and University of Illinois in Chicago's campus (Go Flames!) is close to the UIC Halsted Blue line stop. These six stations all have very similar peaks and valleys, with peak ridership happening in September or October and dropping sharply in December and May. These patterns coincide with the semesters beginning and ending at the respective institutions at each station. I'm not sure about why the peaks and valleys are so sharp at Fullerton, though.
